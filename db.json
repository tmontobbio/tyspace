His tattoos weren't even that cool. Mine are going to be so much better. I would totally have a sleeve by now, but my parents said that I can't get any tattoos untill I turn eighteen. I'm definitely going to get one before then. My parents will never know. I'm thinking that my first one is going to be a skull. After we made up, Vanessa told me that my first tattoo should be our initails in a heart. I told her that was a lame idea, and now we're fighting again. Why can't she just get over it?"

I don't know what she's talking about because I know exactly where everything is in here. I have a system, and it works. She just doesn't understand my aesthetic. Whatever. Lucky for her, I can't go too much longer just listening to the thoughts inside my head, so I guess I'll clean my room. Lame."
